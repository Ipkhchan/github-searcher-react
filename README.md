A live version of this project can be found at the following link:

https://github-searcher-react.herokuapp.com/

I have also created the same project with pure vanilla javascript (except JQuery just for AJAX calls). The Github repo can be found here (https://github.com/Ipkhchan/github-searcher).

RUNNING THIS PROJECT  
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate into the repository locally.
3. Run "yarn install". (Install yarn first if you do not have it.)
4. Create a .env file in the root directory of the repository and add the following text,
   replacing YOUR-PERSONAL-TOKEN-HERE with your Github personal access token. If you do
   not have one, create one by following the instructions here (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).

    REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR-PERSONAL-TOKEN-HERE"

5. Run "yarn start".
